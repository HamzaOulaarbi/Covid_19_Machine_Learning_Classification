# Covid_19_Machine_Learning_Classification
Diagnosis of COVID-19 and its clinical spectrum

# Dataset
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

# Task Details
